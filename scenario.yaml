name: Phishing for Profit
description: Kurtis Black, a tech-savvy 30-year-old, attempts to steal cryptocurrency through targeted phishing emails sent to online gamers, including Jamie Ortega. Unfortunately for Kurtis, he uses his personal email account in the process, leaving a traceable link back to him. While Samantha Reed innocently uses the same computer, her unrelated activities create background noise that further mystifies the investigation while ultimately leading to Kurtis's capture due to his careless employment of personal correspondence.
